# WEB-NAVBAR
A web navigation bar is like a menu at the top of a website that helps people easily find and visit different pages or sections of the site. It usually contains clickable links or buttons for things like the homepage, about us, contact, and more. It's a helpful tool for users to move around your website and find what they're looking for.
